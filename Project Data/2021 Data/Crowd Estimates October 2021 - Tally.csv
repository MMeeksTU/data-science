Women's March and more than 90 other organizations, including National Latina Institute for Reproductive Health, Planned Parenthood, SHERO Mississippi, Mississippi in Action, Access Reproductive Care-Southeast, The Frontline, Working Families Party, and SisterSong, are organizing a national call to mobilize and defend our reproductive rights.  Abortion has never been fully accessible, but we are at the risk of losing our reproductive freedom completely. The call to action is clear, and urgent. The relentless attacks from Texas to Mississippi are ramping up quickly. Anti-choice extremists have a deep desire to return to a time when there was more clear and effective domination and control over queer and trans folks, women, and people of color; they want to revive those old values and societal norms to the point of re-acceptance. The authoritarian agenda of reproductive control is fueled by misogyny and racism - and we must challenge it, together.  On October 1st, we’re going to send the Supreme Court and lawmakers across the country a clear, unified message. The attack on our reproductive rights will not be tolerated.  We have this opportunity to invite all the people that know us and love us into this important movement and work united as we build something better for our families and communities. As a small powerful group tries to come for our human rights over and over again, we’ll never let go of our vision of reproductive justice; for unfettered abortion access and everything we need to support and grow our families to thrive and live healthy lives.  This is your fight. This is our fight. This impacts all of us. Pledge today to rally and rise up with the Handmaids on October 1st.  Please remember that we are still in a pandemic and your health, and that of those around you, is especially important. We are committed to maintaining public health measures to practice safe protesting during the pandemic. All event participants are expected to wear a mask, maintain social distancing, have weighed their own risk in attending, and follow all local safety guidelines at minimum, and any safety instructions from hosts that exceed local law.  As with our previous events, the same rules apply. We will not engage in any acts of violence or violation of any applicable laws or engage in civil disobedience. All actions will be peaceful. Everyone participating in this event will be required to behave lawfully to ensure the safety of event participants and will seek to de-escalate any potential confrontation with those who disagree with our values. We will obey the orders of authorized event marshals and law enforcement authorities. Event organizers will not be responsible for any injury or damage if any were to occur during this event. We will park in the Courthouse parking lot without blocking access lanes and will remove any trash that is left.",,https://womensmarch.com/,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

It is an issue that concerns us all.  On October 2nd, women, uterus owners, and those who love them will gather in the parking area of the Taylor County Courthouse in support of Reproductive Choice on October 2nd for a program of celebration and public testimony of the power of Choice in our lives.     We will then proceed through downtown Abilene, sending a message loud and clear to the US Supreme Court - that as “The Notorious” Ruth Bader Ginsburg once said: “The decision whether or not to bear a child is central to a woman's life, to her well-being and dignity. It is a decision she must make for herself.”     Attendees can participate in car procession to City Hall or march around the Courthouse on the sidewalk socially distanced.    Also, as reproductive choice is pre-requisite to the wellbeing of Democracy, so too is public health and safety. We will require all participants and attendees to follow the most recent CDC Guidelines, to mask and social distance responsibly, to help stop the spread of Covid-19.     Car decorating (first come first served) and voter registration will both be available before the event. Take note that there is no public restroom but port-a-potty will be on premises for public use.    Pro-Choice is Pro-Life.

SB 8 is a new Texas law that bans Texans' from accessing abortion services after six weeks. Most people don't even know they are pregnant at six weeks!  It also allows private citizens in Texas the power to sue someone who provides an abortion or helps someone get an abortion outside of the 6 week restriction for at least a $10,000 bounty!  Texas' passing of this law serves as a test for other states to follow with similar laws, specifically Ohio. We have already seen similar bans show up locally in Ohio. Therefore, we are taking a stand so people in Texas and everywhere else can have access to abortion care!  Come out and take a stand for safe, legal abortion access!

BRING SIGNS!    On October 2, we're marching in every single state ahead of the Supreme Court reconvening on October 4.   Women's March and more than 90 other organizations, including National Latina Institute for Reproductive Justice, Planned Parenthood, SHERO Mississippi, Mississippi in Action, Access Reproductive Care-Southeast, The Frontline, Working Families Party, and SisterSong, are organizing a national call to mobilize and defend our reproductive rights.    Abortion has never been fully accessible, but we are at the risk of losing our reproductive freedom completely. The call to action is clear, and urgent. The relentless attacks from Texas to Mississippi are ramping up quickly. Anti-choice extremists have a deep desire to return to a time when there was more clear and effective domination and control over queer and trans folks, women, and people of color; they want to revive those old values and societal norms to the point of re-acceptance. The authoritarian agenda of reproductive control is fueled by misogyny and racism - and we must challenge it, together.    On October 2, we’re going to send the Supreme Court and lawmakers across the country a clear, unified message. The attack on our reproductive rights will not be tolerated.    We have this opportunity to invite all the people that know us and love us into this important movement and work united as we build something better for our families and communities. As a small powerful group tries to come for our human rights over and over again, we’ll never let go of our vision of reproductive justice; for unfettered abortion access and everything we need to support and grow our families to thrive and live healthy lives.    This is your fight. This is our fight. This impacts all of us. Take the pledge today.

Calling on all women across racial, ethic, socioeconomic, religious and gender lines, and their supporters. This event will begin with a noon rally on Market Square followed by a 1:30 pm march.  Event address: Market Square Park across from the West Side Market in Cleveland at the corner of W 25th Street and Lorain Avenue.  Women's March Cleveland will join cities nationwide and Women's March National in Washington, D.C. to host a local rally and march in Cleveland.  The event is a rally and march for reproductive and Civil rights  in the midst of the recent Texas court ruling against reproductive rights and the attack on Roe v. Wade by the conservative right and state legislatures across the country.     The Women's March will convene mass mobilization events next month in city's nationwide to protest this controversial new abortion law in Texas and to fight against such type of laws popping up in other states. No doubt, Ohio is at risk for such a proposed law that might be offered by lawmakers in its state legislature. in fact such-type bills have been introduced in at least six other states since this most recent Texas law against abortion took effect. Ohio tried this previously with the heartbeat bill and its restrictions on abortion and later lost in the courts  . A woman's right to choose what happens with her body, whether in Ohio or elsewhere, is a constitutional right per the 1973  landmark Supreme Court decision in Roe v. Wade. that made abortion legal nationwide.      Why our fight matters: The Texas law bans abortions after six weeks and does not exempt cases of rape or incest. Considered one of the most restrictive abortion laws in the U.S. since the 1973 Roe v. Wade decision, the new law has incited widespread outrage among abortion-rights advocates.    Details: Women's March and over 90 other organizations are organizing a national call to mobilize on Oct. 2 and ""defend our reproductive rights."" We will hold marches in ""every single state"" ahead of the Supreme Court reconvening on Oct. 4 On this date the Supreme Court will hear oral arguments in an abortion rights case out of Jackson, Mississippi.    Also at issue is violence against women and the attack on voting rights and on Civil Rights in general against women, Blacks, people of color, poor people, and others across the country. We will fight for the voting, civil and reproductive rights of women in Cleveland, in greater Cleveland, in Ohio, and in the country. And we want jobs, and equal pay as well as a minimum wage and access to quality healthcare. We want safe and affordable housing, criminal justice reform, educational equity and fair redistricting of congressional and state house and senate districts in Ohio. We call for police to value Black lives as if they were their own, and we support the LGBTQ community. We denounce mass incarceration, racism, sexism, excessive force,  religious bigotry, and discrimination in any form or fashion.    A list of speakers for the event is forthcoming. In addition to the host group of Women's March Cleveland, other participating groups for Women's March Cleveland's Oct 2, 2021 march include International Women's Day March Cleveland, Planned Parenthood at the national level, Imperial Women Coalition, Black Women's PAC of greater Cleveland, Cuyahoga County Democratic Women's Caucus, National Congress of Black Women greater Cleveland chapter,  Refusefacism, Clevelandurbannews.com,  Greater Cleveland Independent Black Journalists, Brickhouse Wellness Center, the Carl Stokes Brigade, End Poverty Now Cleveland, and more.

They chose the same location and will be meeting at 1:00. I am not canceling this event because I don’t want the people who RSVP’d to think they shouldn’t show up. Thank you! (We cannot stand back and watch Texas take away a woman’s right to make a medical decision that is between her and her doctor. We must use our voices to help all women keep that right in all 50 states.

Other states, including Arkansas, Florida, South Carolina, South Dakota, Kentucky, Louisiana, Oklahoma, and Ohio have already declared their intention to follow Texas’ example.     Lower courts are bound by Supreme Court decisions unless they are overturned. Roe v. Wade is still the law of the land. We repudiate the Texas abortion ban and the Illegitimate Supreme Court that won’t even enforce it’s own precedent by striking down the Texas ban.     Because Republicans know that a majority of Americans support the right to abortion, their strategy is to make this end-run around established judicial precedent. Their strategy is to limit the right to the abortion so fully as to be equatable with a ban on abortion. They are also dangerously encouraging vigilante behavior among an already radicalized right, turning neighbor against neighbor, and luring people to turn each other in to the government for cash in this Covid-ravaged economy.      The wealthy will always have access to abortion. They can fly, they can pay. It is disproportionately women of color, poor women, and other marginalized people, including trans men and non-binary people, who will be denied access.     The openly partisan, extreme-right Supreme Court built by Trump is illegitimate. Sexual offender Brett Kavanaugh will NEVER tell us what we can and can’t do with our bodies.     The Black Lives Matter movement which shook America last summer showed us the way. Our power is in the streets.     The Women’s Movement in 2016 also gave us a glimpse of our potential power, before it was diverted into electoral politics-as-usual.     Trusting our fates to the Supreme Court or the equally flawed parties of the “Two Party System” Democrats or Republicans is a failed strategy. Abortion rights have been eroded for decades. The Democrats haven’t passed any federal legislation to protect us for 40 years--even when they had super majorities. Republicans have also failed us with abortion rights for obvious reasons such as mixing church and state and passing consistently unjust laws against reproductive rights.     It is time to build a new abortion rights movement, fighting in the streets and overcoming every obstacle to our ability to live a free and meaningful life. Hand in hand with our siblings of every race, nationality, gender, and sexual identity, we pledge to organize and fight until this world is worthy of us.     Join us on October 2nd for a march, open mic, and a mass strategy meeting to defend our right to abortion. Come with your proposals, votes will be taken on the best way forward.

Youth4Unity, Rise Up Doylestown, NAACP Bucks County, Planned Parenthood Keystone, Bucks Liberation Coalition, Central Bucks YDSA, Bucks County Women’s Advocacy Coalition, and many other partnered organizations are part of this call to mobilize and defend our reproductive rights.     Abortion has never been fully accessible, but we are at the risk of losing our reproductive freedom completely. The call to action is clear, and urgent. The relentless attacks from Texas to Mississippi to Pennsylvania are ramping up quickly. Anti-choice extremists have a deep desire to return to a time when there was more clear and effective domination and control over queer and trans folks, women, and people of color; they want to revive those old values and societal norms to the point of re-acceptance. The authoritarian agenda of reproductive control is fueled by misogyny and racism - and we must challenge it, together.    On October 2, we’re going to send the Supreme Court and lawmakers across the country a clear, unified message. The attack on our reproductive rights will not be tolerated.    We have this opportunity to invite all the people that know us and love us into this important movement and work united as we build something better for our families and communities. As a small powerful group tries to come for our human rights over and over again, we’ll never let go of our vision of reproductive justice; for unfettered abortion access and everything we need to support and grow our families to thrive and live healthy lives.    This is your fight. This is our fight. This impacts all of us.

On September 1, 2021, the extreme and unconstitutional abortion ban known as SB8 went in to effect in Texas. The law bans abortion after approximately six weeks gestation, before most people even know they are pregnant. The law also allows any private citizen from anywhere in the country to sue any person- a doctor, a sister, a brother, a mother, a friend- who helps a person access an abortion in Texas after six weeks.  This law, along with the extremists who support it, actively encourages private citizens to insert themselves into the private medical decisions of other private citizens for a cash payout.  Restrictions like Texas’ new abortion ban are designed to control, stigmatize, and create a reality where your zip code determines whether you can access abortion. In El Paso, we have been fighting for equitable access for generations and we will continue fighting now.  We believe in a future where no person is faced with shame or fear when seeking safe, legal health care. We believe in a future in which every person has the opportunity to live their lives and make health decisions that are best for themselves and their families.

Our right to access safe, legal abortion is in the most serious danger it has been in 48 years. Almost 5 decades ago, the Supreme Court said that your constitutional right to privacy extended to your right to access an abortion. This year, the Supreme Court reconvenes on October 4th and will be hearing a case on a 15-week abortion ban in Mississippi. With the addition of three new conservative justices it is possible the court will overturn all or parts of Roe v Wade and eliminate access to safe and legal abortion for millions across the country.  The devastating abortion ban we saw enacted in Texas last week is just one of over 90 egregious and harmful anti-abortion bills enacted across the country this year alone, with over 400 more bills in state legislatures right now-- including one in Alaska to amend our State Constitution. Abortion rights across the United States-- including here in Alaska-- are under attack. But we’re not giving up.    Mark your calendars for Planned Parenthood Alliance Advocates - Alaska’s statewide DAY OF ACTION on Saturday October 2nd. We will be holding events in communities across the state! We look forward to finding ways to safely support each other, get loud, find joy and catharsis, and tell our legislators across Alaska to keep their #BansOffOurBodies!    We will be releasing more details soon! Please spread the word and invite your friends, family, lovers, classmates, etc to help us get loud and protect our right to SAFE, LEGAL abortion! If you’re interested in volunteering or want to help in other ways, please fill out this quick form and we will be in touch! See you there!!!    https://forms.gle/JfZxPwuAWgkiQo6a7",,https://womensmarch.com/,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

When the Supreme Court rejected an emergency request to block Texas's abortion ban, they effectively took the next step towards overturning Roe v. Wade. Ron DeSantis has already expressed his support of the Heartbeat bill, and Republican legislators have verbalized their support. We must defend our reproductive rights! Right now, across this state Republican leaders are taking actions to restrict a woman’s right to choose!    We must let our voices be heard!  Oct 2nd across the nation protests will be held to fight for our right to safe and effective reproductive health choices and to stand in solidarity with the women in Texas. On Oct 2nd we must demand a stop to Ron DeSantis's draft of his own Florida Heartbeat bill.    Jacksonville organizations are combining forces to host our own demonstrations to send a clear message to Florida legislators – “Our Body – Our Choice”.     Demonstration will consist of 3 parts: a caravan, a rally at the courthouse, and a march to City Hall.  Masks and social distancing are required. Please note that these events are not only for women, but for anyone who supports body autonomy. Anyone who supports reproductive rights is welcome to attend. Please RSVP to be added to our attendee list and receive updates as we get closer to the event.      You are welcome at all 3 events, or you can participate as you see fit.    Our Body - Our Choice Car Caravan    The car caravan is an excellent opportunity for those with COVID concerns or risks to join in the demonstration and experience little to no exposure to other participants.   All participants are asked to mask up when they are outside of their vehicles.    Car caravans will be initiated at various points across the city and converge on the Courthouse on Adams Street, where the Our Body- Our Choice Rally will be held.    Participants are asked to arrive by 9:15am to decorate their cars with signs and banners and line up in an orderly fashion.    Caravans will depart their start points at 10:00am and proceed at approximately 30-35mph through designated portions of town be fore they terminate at the Courthouse at 10:45am where participants can park and join in the Rally.     A complete list of the caravan start points will be announced on social media, and via email within the coming days.         Our Body- Our Choice Rally    The in-person rally will be held at 501 W. Adams St. and is slated to begin at 11:00am. The rally will feature legislative leaders, community organization leaders, and activists.  Stay tuned for a complete list of speakers.    Our Body- Our Choice March    After the rally we will march, carrying our message to City Hall for some unified chanting, and then march back to the courthouse for our final speakers. The march will start no later than 12:00pm.    After the march we encourage all participates who feel comfortable with public events to join in the River City Pride Festival. Let’s remember that Body Autonomy impacts all of us. Our right to choose, our body our choice, doesn’t apply just to women. While today’s fight might be reproductive rights, remember it is only one cog in the wheel of power and control that others seek to gain over us.

This law makes it illegal to obtain an abortion once a fetal heartbeat is detected, unless it is a medical emergency. This law does not make any exclusions for people who became pregnant due to sexual abuse, rape or incest. This law also makes it possible for anyone to file a civil suit against anyone they believe to have performed an abortion or aided in someone getting an abortion after 6 weeks (ie the Uber/Lyft driver that drove you to the appointment).  Texas is the 11th state since 2018 to propose a heartbeat bill and the only state with a heartbeat bill currently in effect. Did you know several states have heartbeat bills on hold due to legal battles?  Arkansas  Oklahoma  South Carolina  Tennessee  Missouri  The time to take a stand is now. Help us spread the message that our government has no business telling us what we can or can not do with our uteruses.

ALL ARE WELCOME- This affects everyone!    We are pleased to announce our intention to hold a brief rally and walk in downtown McMinnville, participating in solidarity with Womens' Marches in many other cities across the nation. Our purpose is to support the reproductive rights of women, and their legal choice in pregnancy to complete or terminate that pregnancy. Given the recent unconstitutional actions by the state of Texas that deny women these rights and the rewarded vigilantism that will enforce their new law, American women's legal reproductive choice is at great risk. This has motivated many women in and around McMinnville to gather to make a public statement taking a stand for our own rights.         At noon on Saturday October 2nd, we plan to gather in the Civic Hall(outdoors) to collect our participants and hold a brief rally. We are currently exploring potential speakers for that rally. Realistically, we anticipate a relatively small crowd, with less than 100 attending. There will be concurrent Womens' Marches in Salem and Portland that will draw large crowds.  Once our rally is finished, we propose to walk en masse up 3rd St to Galloway, Galloway to 2nd, 2nd to Baker, Baker to 3rd, then return to our rallying point at the city park. Upon our return to the park, we expect to disperse, ending this event.  We are asking everyone in attendance to wear a face mask, and position themselves using appropriate social distancing. Participants will also be reminded to behave with courtesy and consideration of our neighbors, particularly while walking adjacent to local businesses and residences.  Should there be ""counter protesters"" attempting to disrupt our event, our own participants will be directed to not engage, not argue, not escalate. We will conduct ourselves in a calm and respectful manner. We will most certainly contact McMinnville PD if any assistance is needed.",,https://womensmarch.com/,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Firstly, the red cloak is a symbol of reproductive suppression above all else, Margrette Atwood's novel and now the show adaptation has 1 common theme and it is the suppression of people who have the ability to give birth. This event is not in anyway a narrative about her or the actual show or novel because that's not the point, but a way of using a popular image to express the similarities to this fictional dystopia and the very real dystopian future we are headed twords.     This event is ALL inclusive. We are fighting a repressive government that values the life of a zygote more than ANYONE with the ability to actually carry it.  This includes all of our POC, BIPOC, trans, intersex and non binary friends as well as anyone else who will fight for the rights of our neighbors. We are all effected by these restrictive laws, even here in Oregon.      People of color who can carry a pregnancy are among the most targeted groups in this country when it comes down to reproductive rights.     Black women are 4 TIMES more likely to die during child birth, and as we all know the ""Father of modern gynecology"" used black women to experiment on so rich white women could benefit from the training and research he got from Black women's suffering. These are the issues we are fighting against first and foremost, and the red cloak is just to get their attention.     The whole country is fighting against these laws, and it's our duty to force people to face the grousome reality of what is happening, we cannot let people be comfortable with letting this happen.     Be loud and un-apologetic about protecting reproductive rights for ALL of our people, this is a battle we cannot lose!    <U+2757><U+2757><U+2757>AS PER STATE GUIDELINES, MASKS REQUIRED WHERE SOCIAL DISTANCING NOT POSSIBLE<U+2757><U+2757><U+2757>",,https://womensmarch.com/,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

As you have no doubt seen in the news, the Supreme Court turned its back on 50 years of precedent, rendering Roe v. Wade effectively meaningless in Texas. The Supreme Court declined to block the 6-week ban, setting a scary precedent for future court decisions. This law gives anyone in the country, including curbside clinic protestors and abusive partners, the right to sue a Texan who helps someone get an abortion, with an incentive of at least $10,000. Taken alongside the Supreme Court's decision to hear arguments in the Mississippi 15-week ban case, brought by Jackson Women's Health Organization, this fall, our movement is facing a grave threat to abortion access and rights in decades with grave implications for communities across the country.    If we don't act now, Tennessee will be next. The Tennessee legislature passed a “trigger law” that automatically bans abortion as soon as Roe v. Wade is fully or partially overturned. We are facing a possible total abortion ban in Tennessee within a matter of months.

Masks required at this event.*  OUR RIGHT TO SAFE, LEGAL ABORTION IN TENNESSEE IS IN SERIOUS DANGER.  The Supreme Court has failed millions of Texans. In the dead of the night, the Supreme Court turned its back on 50 years of precedent, rendering Roe v. Wade effectively meaningless in Texas. The Supreme Court declined to block the 6-week ban, setting a scary precedent for future court decisions. This law gives anyone in the country, including curbside clinic protestors and abusive partners, the right to sue a Texan who helps someone get an abortion, with an incentive of at least $10,000.  If we don’t act now, Tennessee will be next. The legislature here in Tennessee has a “trigger law” put in place that automatically bans abortion as soon as Roe v. Wade is fully or partially overturned. Governor Bill Lee signed into law an abortion ban last year, which is currently held up in court. This means we are mere months away from a possible total abortion ban in Tennessee.  Join us to march from the State Capitol, to AT&T (who was the largest corporate donor to the sponsors of SB8, the TX abortion ban), and we'll end at the Federal Courthouse. The entire route is 1.2 miles.  In addition, the Supreme Court of the United States has taken on a case from Mississippi centered on a 15-week abortion ban. The case, Dobbs v. Jackson Women's Health Organization, is the first major challenge to Roe v. Wade we have seen since significant shifts to our Supreme Court. The case is expected to be heard as early as December with a ruling in 2022.  It's time for us to fight back at a level we never have before. In order to protect our rights and have our voices heard, we have to show up, and show up LOUD. October 2 is days before the SCOTUS term.

Our focus is on reproductive rights for all women, thus we are calling it the Roanoke Rally for Reproductive Rights. In simplest terms, we believe that every woman should be able to choose what is right for her. We do not  believe that others should dictate what healthcare resources are legally available to them. Our priorities are safety and well being for everyone, both in the present and in the future. We expect to have a voter registration booth, educational materials to disperse, speakers to share their stories, and we are doing our absolute best to create a general atmosphere that promotes respect, responsibility, safety, and integrity. We know this is a highly controversial topic and we are trying to promote a socio-cultural shift that encourages people to kindly respect and support women who have to make what is often one of the most difficult decisions of their lives. We also know we cannot do it alone, that part is obvious. We are working tirelessly to collaborate with various members of the community to make this event meaningful and lead to people being authentically passionate about guiding others to find that intrinsic motivation within themselves and push for lasting, concrete changes in our community. We are grateful for everyone who has made the commitment to stand beside other women even through these incredibly challenging times. We humbly request your attendance on October 2nd, 2021 at the location listed below. Please RSVP so that we can allot appropriate time and resources for everyone.

Abortion has never been fully accessible, but we are at the risk of losing our reproductive freedom completely. The call to action is clear, and urgent. The relentless attacks from Texas to Mississippi are ramping up quickly. Anti-choice extremists have a deep desire to return to a time when there was more clear and effective domination and control over queer and trans folks, women, and people of color; they want to revive those old values and societal norms to the point of re-acceptance. The authoritarian agenda of reproductive control is fueled by misogyny and racism - and we must challenge it, together.

Wear comfortable clothing and walking shoes.    Posters, signs, banners, and noisemakers are strongly encouraged.    Wear a mask!!! We will have masks and hand sanitizer available and will follow all CDC Covid-19 guidelines.    Wear Orange!! Why Wear Orange?  Orange is the color that represents the fight for access to safe & legal abortions in Texas since the 2013 Wendy Davis' thirteen-hour-long filibuster to block Senate Bill 5, a measure which included more restrictive abortion regulations for Texas. We continue wearing orange to honor and continue that fight.    If you would like to wear your own costume or outfit please honor these guidelines: No Handmaiden Outfits & avoid hangers and the appearance of the dangers of illegal abortions - Per Women's March National.  Here's some articles why:   Handmaiden imagery pushes a white agenda that ignores the historic and on-going harm to POC.  We want to uplift and honor the struggle of the most affected - not detract.  https://nyunews.com/opinion/2021/09/09/texas-handmaids-tale-white-feminism/    Hangers are great fodder for patronizing anti-choice rhetoric.  https://www.salon.com/2019/05/09/abortion-war-heats-up-and-coat-hanger-argument-is-backfiring-on-pro-choice-movement/    That said, this is your march and you can express what you need to express.",,https://womensmarch.com/,https://www.instagram.com/p/CT0VWvwjh0O/?utm_source=ig_web_copy_link,https://twitter.com/KENS5/status/1444369875833663491,https://www.kens5.com/article/news/community/san-antonio-abortion-rights-rally-texas/273-eec59418-38eb-4c4e-8a82-e25125e89189,https://www.sandiegouniontribune.com/news/health/story/2021-10-02/thousands-march-for-reproductive-rights-in-san-diego,https://www.expressnews.com/politics/article/I-need-to-do-something-Thousands-oppose-16505051.php,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Women's March San José along with Enough Is Enough Voter Project, Action Together Bay Area and Pandia Health are organizing this call to mobilize and defend our reproductive rights in San José.  Abortion has never been fully accessible, but we are at the risk of losing our reproductive freedom completely. The call to action is clear, and urgent. The relentless attacks from Texas to Mississippi are ramping up quickly. Anti-choice extremists have a deep desire to return to a time when there was more clear and effective domination and control over queer and trans folks, women, and people of color; they want to revive those old values and societal norms to the point of re-acceptance. The authoritarian agenda of reproductive control is fueled by misogyny and racism - and we must challenge it, together.  On Oct 2, we’re going to send the Supreme Court and lawmakers across the country a clear, unified message. The attack on our reproductive rights will not be tolerated.  We have this opportunity to invite all the people that know us and love us into this important movement and work united as we build something better for our families and communities. As a small powerful group tries to come for our human rights over and over again, we’ll never let go of our vision of reproductive justice; for unfettered abortion access and everything we need to support and grow our families to thrive and live healthy lives.  This is your fight. This is our fight. This impacts all of us. Please join us and rise up on Oct 2.   We are requesting all participants wear a mask.

This year, as Roe vs. Wade hangs by a thread, our communities will stand as a united front.       The relentless attacks from Texas to Mississippi are ramping up quickly. Anti-choice extremists have a deep desire to return to a time when there was more clear and effective domination and control over queer and trans folks, women, and people of color; they want to revive those old values and societal norms to further marginalize those who are already isolated from accessible, quality healthcare, reproductive autonomy, and safe & legal abortions. The authoritarian agenda of reproductive control is fueled by misogyny and racism - and we must challenge it, together.     Abortion has never been fully accessible to all, but we are at the risk of losing our reproductive freedom completely. The call to action has never been more urgent.      We MUST get out the vote in favor of reproductive freedom and accessible healthcare for all. Today and everyday, we are sending a clear message to our lawmakers and the Supreme Court: The People’s Rights for Reproductive Freedom will stand!     Visit PinkWave.org for more info.

We march because the pain of Texas is our pain. From income inequality to racial justice to the environment, it is all impacted by access to legal, affordable, destigmatized abortion. No one can get an abortion in Texas after 6 weeks.  Nine states only have one abortion clinic. Birth control is on the line. Clinics providing birth control, STD screening and referrals to get an abortion are already permanently shut down in many states. The Supreme Court reconvenes on October 4th and all of us must show up to support reproductive freedom.   Masks Required  Do not block the street or parking or businesses.

On September 1, 2021, the latest and most egregious law opposing freedom of choice went into effect in Texas. Texas SB8 allows private citizens to police the actions of anyone who helps a woman obtain an abortion after 6 weeks gestation. The law permits and encourages civil lawsuits against medical providers, drivers, family and friends of women who are exercising their right to choose granted to them under the 14th Amendment as affirmed by Roe v. Wade in 1973. Citing “procedural questions,” the United States Supreme Court refused to provide relief from the law, despite its obvious unconstitutionality. Several state legislatures, including our legislature in Arizona, have signaled that they will use the Texas law as framework for their own abortion bans. We know that abortion bans are about power over people with uteruses and our right to reproductive freedom. We know that laws like SB8 are just the beginning of the latest assault on our right to choose. So, WE ARE MARCHING.    Join us on Saturday, October 2nd at 10:00 am at Armory Park. This event does not include a rally. Rather, we have organized a peaceful procession with our own safety marshaling so that police are not involved and everyone can feel safe and welcome. We will obey all traffic ordinances. Our route is accessible, and we will have extra help available for anyone who needs assistance participating in the march. This is an all ages event, with signs and chants which will be safe for anyone from ages 2 to 102. Every human is welcome to march with us! In accordance with the CDC and the Women’s March National Organization, we will be observing COVID-19 safety protocols. Masks are required for participants, and social distancing will be observed wherever possible.     We will march from Armory Park to Jacome Plaza in Downtown Tucson. Wear comfortable shoes and make a plan for hydration. Please see below for the COVID-19 guidelines, straight from The Women’s March National Organization:    We are marching as a demonstration of our love and commitment to each other. We also know we are in a devastating and terrifying surge of the Delta variant. We can hold both.  In order to protect and care for each other, we require that all participants wear masks, maintain proper social distance, and use hand sanitizer before passing anything out or touching any shared objects like bullhorns or banners. These common-sense guidelines are non-negotiable, a reflection of our deep commitment to keeping each other safe.    We have merchandise!

Right now we are facing the worst attacks on our bodily autonomy, our right to choose when and how to have a family, and our access to basic and safe health care in the form of abortions that we've seen in 50 years.    We don’t say this lightly: We are at grave risk of losing our reproductive freedom completely. From local abortion bans being passed in states like Texas and Mississippi, to the highest court in our land refusing to defend our constitutional rights – we are witnessing the most direct and dire threats to our reproductive health in our lifetimes. Politicians will not stop after destroying our reproductive rights but will continue to create legislation in order to control all aspects of our lives.    The devastating abortion ban we saw enacted in Texas last week is just one of over 90 egregious and harmful anti-abortion bills enacted across the country this year alone, with over 400 more bills in state legislatures right now-- including one in Alaska to amend our State Constitution.    We are at a pivotal moment in history. We can be defined as the generation that stood against tyranny and disinformation. We can be known for fighting for what is right, for our community, for our right to choose. Stand in solidarity with us and use your voice to dismantle the unjust system of oppression designed to hold us down!

Marches will be held on this day across the nation, because our right to access safe, legal abortion is in the most serious danger it has been in 48 years. Almost five decades ago, the Supreme Court said that your constitutional right to privacy extended to your right to access an abortion. This year, the Supreme Court reconvenes on October 4th and will be hearing a case on a 15-week abortion ban in Mississippi. With the addition of three new conservative justices it is possible the court will overturn all or parts of Roe v Wade and eliminate access to safe and legal abortion for millions across the country.  The devastating abortion ban we saw enacted in Texas last week is just one of over 90 egregious and harmful anti-abortion bills enacted across the country this year alone, with over 400 more bills in state legislatures right now-- including one in Alaska to amend our State Constitution.    Abortion rights across the United States-- including here in Alaska-- are under attack. But we’re not giving up!    We will be holding events in communities across the state! We look forward to finding ways to safely support each other, get loud, find joy and catharsis, and tell our legislators across Alaska to keep their #BansOffOurBodies! Guests, please remember that trans men, non-binary people and more LGBTQ+ can get pregnant and can have an abortion, meaning that this is an LGBTQ+ issue just as much as a women's issue.

Planned Parenthood, Centex Action Network, and others who are organizing a call to mobilize and defend our reproductive rights.     Abortion has never been fully accessible, but we are at the risk of losing our reproductive freedom completely. The call to action is clear, and urgent. The relentless attacks from Texas to Mississippi are ramping up quickly. Anti-choice extremists have a deep desire to return to a time when there was more clear and effective domination and control over queer and trans folks, women, and people of color; they want to revive those old values and societal norms to the point of re-acceptance. The authoritarian agenda of reproductive control is fueled by misogyny and racism - and we must challenge it, together.    On October 2, we're going to send the Supreme Court and lawmakers across the country a clear, unified message. The attack on our reproductive rights will not be tolerated.    We have this opportunity to invite all the people that know us and love us into this important movement and work united as we build something better for our families and communities. As a small powerful group tries to come for our human rights over and over again, we’ll never let go of our vision of reproductive justice; for unfettered abortion access and everything we need to support and grow our families to thrive and live healthy lives.    This is your fight. This is our fight. This impacts all of us. Rise up wherever you are on October 2.     Are you a vendor?

Stop companies from continued destruction of our forests and respect Indigenous rights We will be disrupting business as usual. There is no exact end time for this action.
